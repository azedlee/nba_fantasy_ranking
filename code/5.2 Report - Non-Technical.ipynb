    "\n",
    "Yahoo, ESPN and other fantasy basketball websites are fairly inaccurate on their pre-ranking system. It is quite well known that many advanced/knowledgeable/experienced players know to never follow any of the ranking system provided by Yahoo, ESPN, etc... because they are terribly inaccurate. From research, Yahoo, ESPN and many other sites use AccuScore.com or Rotowire.com as their base ranking system. Afterwards, each website has their own fantasy \"guru\" that will re-arrange and edit the ranking system based on injury or potential. Third party fantasy \"guru\" websites also seem to work similarly, except they seem to have their own base ranking system and then edited on biased opinion (individually or a group of people). Regardless, all these websites do not have a non-biased, non-opinionated ranking system, which is understandable because ranking players correctly is extremely difficult and everyone has their own opinion on who has more potential. Currently, this seems like the best way to create a better ranking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to beat all their ranking systems by creating a new way to look at how people should refer to drafting. Based on the last 20 seasons, I want to create a customizable grouping system, rather than labeling players on ranks. For example, in standard leagues there are 12 managers drafting 13 players each, which means that there are 13 rounds of drafting. I want to put the 12 best players in the current pool into each round bracket, provide their mean fantasy value per season, their standard deviation and variance in all their seasons. Also, create a 14th bucket for all the other players. Based on these aspects, managers, especially new players, are able to understand what kind of player they are drafting and what kind of risks they will encounter. This, to me, is a much more accurate and effective way of drafting.\n",

    "#### Removed Rows, Columns and Datasets\n",
    "1. Removed Datasets\n",
    "    - Traditional Defense\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: All the columns were duplicates taken from other advanced statistics, except for defensive win shares. Win shares was originally a probable target dummy variable, but was removed, which will be explained later.\n",
    "    - Traditional Opponent\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: Around 50% of the columns were duplicates with other advanced statistics. The dataset itself was rather confusing to work with and took a long time just to understand how it was working. Currently as of 10/11/2016, I did not use this dataset, but in the future with more time, I will definitely explore this dataset a bit more to see how to incorporate it into my analysis.\n",
    "    - Play Type\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: There was only 1 season (2015-16) and fairly new. Good for per season analysis between players, but not a good predictor for fantasy value. Maybe in the future with more data, it may be a better predictor, but as of now, I want to keep data to at least 20 season to keep the information consistent per player.\n",
    "2. Removed Columns\n",
    "    - Player 30-34, 35-39, 40+ ft shooting data\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: Corner 3s are 22ft and NBA 3pt line is 23.75ft. There are less than a handful of players that can shoot beyond 30ft, and even then, they can be considered heaves or a \"Prayer\" shot. Since this is not caused by opponent's individual defense and usually caused by the opponent's team defense, they are not a good indicator to how well a player can contribute to their fantasy value, they are removed. Also, if a player makes 1 heave, he would be ranked much higher than any other player. Same if that player had to shoot a \"Prayer\" shot because the ball was in his hand the last 1 second of the shot clock, it would skew his shooting rank lower, even though he's a good shooter from 3.\n",
    "    - Player's Opponent 30-34, 35-39, 40+ ft shooting data\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: Like the Player's shooting data, they are almost never caused by individual defense, rather caused by team defense. They also might cause skews in the ranking system because if 1 player defended 1 shot that missed, that player would immediately be ranked higher than a ton of players. The same goes to someone like J.R. Smith heaving a shot and making it would cause a good defender to have a terrible ranking.\n",
    "    - Seasons 1946-47 to 1995-96\n",
    "        - **Reasoning**: There are 2 reasons why these seasons were removed. The first reason was not all the statistics were recorded back then. Turnovers was not recorded until the 1977-78 season. Another example would be in the 1950s, only points, field goal made (not attempts), free throw mades, attempts and percentage were recorded. The data isn't useful for analysis. The second reason was advanced statistics were not recorded until 1996-97 season. Thus, I decided to match 20 season of gamelogs with the 20 seasons of advanced statistics.\n",

    "# III. Data Cleaning, Data Munging and Dummy Targets. <a id=data_cleaning></a>\n",
    "The amazing part of the data I scraped is that it is all in JSON format and relatively clean. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to read. The data being relatively clean means it didn't require me to change the data in any way so that my code can read it. Inputting the data into my code was simple and I can immediately get to work on analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data munging and creating dummy variables was more time consuming. Data munging is a process where the data needs to be manually converted through semi-automated tools, which in my case was using Python. Dummy variables are variables I created based on the data that can be independent variables that are tested on to get results. Although the data was fairly clean and all the data I used was in the correct format, I had 20 seasons of data for traditional (base, advanced, shooting, usage, misc), clutch (base, advanced, shooting, usage, misc), shooting (player and their opponent) and player bios and 70 seasons of gamelogs, which is a huge quantity. However, the quantity of data was not an issue. The problem was that there were tons of duplicate columns in multiple datasets where I had to hand pick which columns to keep and which to remove. I also had to create a new \"SEASONS\" column that would help fix issues with the code and allow my code to run smoother when combining datasets together.\n",
    "\n",
    "After deciding which columns to keep and merging columns from subset of datasets (i.e. Traditional base, advanced, shooting, usage, misc, player shooting and opponent shooting), I decided on creating dummy target variables instead of clustering. Clustering is a technique where you are looking for some hidden information within the data. I chose this path because I had a clear idea on what types of dummy variables would be correlated with fantasy value. Also, I was afraid I would be wasting too much time on figure out whether the clusters are targeted toward fantasy value versus real life value. There are only so many groupings that can be made in basketball where I didn't feel like clustering would be an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "After researching ideas through fantasy baseball and football, I had a couple of ideas on what dummy variables to create that may be able to predict better players for fantasy.\n",
    "    1. Aggregate Traditional Total Ranks per Player per Season\n",
    "    2. Aggregate Clutch per48 minute Ranks per Player per Season\n",
    "    3. Games Missed Risk\n",
    "    4. Fantasy Points Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance\n",
    "    5. **REMOVED** Win Shares\n",
    "I decided on these target variables for these reasons:\n",
    "1. I used total values instead of per game, per36, per40 or per48 because I didn't want the players who played fewer games, but had good averages within a span of 10-20 games to skew their value in the wrong direction. The idea is to sort every column from best performance to worst performance, give the player a ranked value, then go to the next column and repeat the process. After achieving a rank for every column, I would sum all the ranks and divide by the number of columns used.\n",
    "2. I used clutch per48 minute instead of totals, per game, per30 or per36 because I wanted to see the huge disparity and variance between players. I also changed the query to 4th quarter with 5 minutes left with the point differentiation no greater than 5. The theory here is that if players perform well under these circumstances, they can equally perform well in any other quarter. Therefore, outputing a more consistent fantasy value. The aggregation technique is the same as the traditional total ranks.\n",
    "3. I created my own Games Missed Rank based on prior experience and knowledge, although the values could be tweaked a bit more. The values are the following:\n",
    "    - Player misses less than 10% of the games in the season - **LOW RISK**\n",
    "    - Player misses between 10% and 25% of the games in the season - **BE CAUTIOUS**\n",
    "    - Player misses between 25% and 50% of the games in the season - **HIGH RISK**\n",
    "    - Player misses more than 50% - **DANGER ZONE**\n",

    "5. Win shares was originally a variable I was really interested in because it calculated how many wins a player contributed to a team. However after hours of research, I decided to remove it because it did not affect a player's fantasy value. The calculation is really complex and would take an atrocious amount of time to calculate. The basic gist of the calculation is Offensive Win Shares + Defensive Win Shares = Total Win Shares. The problem is, defensive win shares tend to favor the team's defensive strength and then projected onto each player. A player may be the worst defender in the league, but have a very high defensive win share because the team was very good defensively. Because of that, defensive win shares must be taken with a huge grain of salt. Now we only have offensive win share to work with. Offensive win shares does a decent job. Offensive win shares calculates the players value and production, which means that players who are underrated or overlooked are accuractly scored. The problem is, offensive win shares cannot predict fantasy value and talent. Chauncey Billups has a career offensive win share of 92.4, where as Larry Bird has a career offensive win share of 86.8, despite Billups playing 1000 less career minutes. Would anyone pick Billups over Bird for their fantasy team even though Bird has better stats across the board in pretty much every category, and, Bird can arguably be one of the best fantasy players ever? No. Offensive win shares contribute towards the team and not the player, therefore, I removing this dummy variable makes sense.\n",

    "Random Forest is an ensemble method for Decision Trees. Ensemble Method is running the same model, over and over again, and then averaging out all the scores for a more robust score. Decision Trees are like real trees. Imagine a real tree. As the tree starts growing, more branches and leaves are made. Now imagine that the stump is your entire data. Suppose that you are classifying whether 1 data point is a cat or dog. The Decision Tree will be like, dog - yes or no. If yes, go to this branch, if no, go to this other branch. Then in those branches it will ask a new question. Is it heavy - yes or no? If yes, go to this other branch, if no, go to this other branch. The Decision Tree will continue to ask questions until it decides, yes, this is a cat. Then it will identify this point as a cat. Random Forest is just a bunch of Decision Trees. This model is helpful for my project because it will help me classify whether this player is an allstar or a bench player by making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor and Classifier was my main modeling tool to predict my 2016-17 fantasy ranks. I chose Random Forest over Decision Trees because it was an ensemble method, which helped me test the strength of my dataset through bagging techniques. But the biggest reason I chose Random Forests was because it will help me categorize continuous variables into groups and split them, based on all my features, to determine a good player versus a bad player. I also figured, Random Forests will be able to help categorize the players in the 14 rounds I wanted to. I can create a new product, or ranking system, which I believe can beat Yahoo, ESPN, CBS and other ranking algorithms. If I wanted to improve my score, I would probably try and use Gradiant Boosted Trees."

I was fairly surprised that my fantasy points mean had an R-squared of 0.99+! R-squared can be thought of how close each point, when compared to the target variable, is to the best fit line. The closer the points are to the line, the higher the R-squared.

However, there may be still some multicollinearity, but I don't think it's a bad thing. Multicollinearity is when 2 or more columns are so correlated that one column can predict the other column at a high accuracy. This may be a problem where the R-squared increases when it shouldn't. However, I doubt removing those features will vastly affect my score because the columns are all good predictors to my dummy targets, so at this point I was ready to move onto Random Forests."

    "Games Missed Risk was expected to perform poorly. I wasn't too surprised with the results because of the initial fantasy points mean density graph. There are more players performing lower than average due to the different amount of games a superstar or allstar performed compared to a bench player or a player on the borderline to being cut. Because of that, the previously games missed risk bar graph showed that low risk and danger had the most volume of players, so the precision that they were correctly identified was higher. Precision is when the model predicts yes, how often is it correct. However, both precision and recall were not great, there were more false negative and false positives than true positives and true negatives. Recall is how often the model predicts yes, and it is actually yes. Hence, the low F1-score. F1-score is the weighted average between precision and recall, where 0 is bad and 1 is good. The higher the value the better the predictor is at guessing correctly. This may be interesting to see if it can be tweaked a bit more, such as moving to 3 classes instead of 4, but I wanted to see how my Random Forest performed in comparison to my logistic regression. The ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a chart that plots the True Positives over the False Positives. The point of the curve is to make sure that when your model is predicting if it is yes or no, at what probability rate is the model predicting yes and it actually is yes, and no when it is actually yes. The diagonal line is the baseline, where guess would be the same probability. Below the line is your model guessing no more, when it is actually yes."

I may have to tweak the train-test split and also run multiple cross validations to make sure that it is returning the correct results, but a simple check on the predicted datasets for next season should give me a good idea on whether they were accurate or not. Train-test split is splitting the data up roughly 75% and 25%, then creating the model with the 75%, then testing on the 25%. This makes sure that the model did not go full bias (which is the model as lazy as possible) or full variance (which is the model trying to hit everything that will only work for that dataset and none other). Cross validation is splitting the data into 5 random, equally chunks, then validating 4 chunks to test on the 1 chunk until each of the 5 chunk was the one being tested on.

But in later rounds it seems past performances have been weighted a bit too strong and I may need to find a way to find a way to balance it statistically. Another thing is, there are players who have been injured during the offseason and won't be back at the beginning of the season, such as Gordon Hayward and Khris Middleton. But if they weren't injured, they are in good positions. Overall, I am happy that my ranking system isn't ridiculously bad and a few tweaks in the weighting system might create a better ranking system."
