Although cannot confirm until the end of the next season, I will use previous seasons to first predict the accuracy of my model."

    "# Current Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahoo, ESPN and other fantasy basketball websites are fairly inaccurate on their pre-ranking system. It is quite well known that many advanced/knowledgeable/experienced players know to never follow any of the ranking system provided by Yahoo, ESPN, etc... because they are terribly inaccurate. From research, Yahoo, ESPN and many other sites use AccuScore.com as their base ranking system. Afterwards, each website has their own fantasy \"pro\" that will re-arrange and edit the ranking system. Third party fantasy \"guru\" websites also seem to work similarly, except they seem to have their own base ranking system and then edited on personal opinion. Regardless, all these websites do not have a non-biased, non-opinionated ranking system, which is understandable because ranking players correctly is extremely difficult and this seems like the current best way to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to beat all their ranking systems by creating a new way to look at how people should refer to drafting. Based on the last 20 seasons, I want to create a customizable grouping system, rather than labeling players on ranks. For example, in standard leagues there are 12 managers drafting 13 players each, which means that there are 13 rounds of drafting. I want to put the 13 best players in the current pool into each round bracket, provide their mean fantasy value per season, their standard deviation and variance in all their seasons. Based on these aspects, managers, especially new players, are able to understand what kind of player they are drafting and what kind of risks they will encounter. This, to me, is a much more accurate and effective way of drafting."

    "        - **Removed**: 30-34, 35-39, 40+ ft shooting. Corner 3s are 22ft and NBA 3pt line is 23.75ft. There are less than a handful of players that can shoot beyond 30ft, and even then, they can be considered heaves or a \"Prayer\" shot. Since this is not caused by opponent's individual defense and usually caused by the opponent's team defense, they are not a good indicator to how well a player can contribute to their fantasy value, they are removed. Also, if a player makes 1 heave, he would be ranked much higher than any other player. Same if that player had to shoot a \"Prayer\" shot because the ball was in his hand the last 1 second of the shot clock, it would skew his shooting rank lower, even though he's a good shooter from 3.\n",
    "    - Opponent Shooting\n",
    "        - **Removed**: 30-34, 35-39, 40+ ft opponent shooting. Like shooting, they are almost never caused by individual defense, rather caused by team defense. They also might cause skews in the ranking system because if 1 player defended 1 shot that missed, that player would immediately be ranked higher than a ton of players. The same goes to someone like J.R. Smith heaving a shot and making it would cause a good defender to have a terrible ranking.\n",

    "    - **Removed**: Opponent dataset because the data is lacking over 50% of the players information, skews agg rank\n",

    "Win shares are not as strong as of a fantasy target as I originally thought about. The calculation is also really complex and would take an atrocious amount of time to calculate. The basic gist of the calculation is Offensive Win Shares + Defensive Win Shares = Total Win Shares. The problem is, defensive win shares tend to favor the team's defensive strength and then projected onto each player. A player may be the worst defender in the league, but have a very high defensive win share because the team was very good defensively. Because of that, defensive win shares must be taken with a huge grain of salt. Now we only have offensive win share to work with. Offensive win shares does a decent job. Offensive win shares calculates the players value and production, which means that players who are underrated or overlooked are accuractly scored. The problem is, offensive win shares cannot predict fantasy value and talent. Chauncey Billups has a career offensive win share of 92.4, where as Larry Bird has a career offensive win share of 86.8, despite Billups playing 1000 less career minutes. Would anyone pick Billups over Bird for their fantasy team even though Bird has better stats across the board in pretty much every category, and, Bird can arguably be one of the best fantasy players ever? No. Offensive win shares contribute towards the team and not the player, therefore, I am removing this dummy target completely.\n",

    "The reasoning behind using per48 minutes for clutch stats instead of per36 or per40 is because per48 you can see behavior changes easier. It is a very useful way to increase bias and variance and solely for comparing players and should not be used to do in game analysis. This is good for me since I want to see consistency and variance from their clutch stats in the 4th quarter with 5 min or less left and neither team is up by more than 5 points. If the player is consistent within these ranges, he theoretically is as good and consistent in all other quarters.\n",
